\begin{frame}{Grading Scheme}
The finalized grading scheme is:
\begin{equation*}
	\textrm{Your score} = 10 \times \frac{\textrm{Your final rank}}{\textrm{Total number of participants}}
\end{equation*}
Your score will be rounded to a precision of 0.1.

\begin{block}{Check Your Grades}
Please check your rank and grades posted on Canvas next week, and report problems before class.	
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Deadline and Naming}
Your deadline is extended to 4 pm UTC (as suggested by Google, midnight today).

To speed-up grading, please do BOTH the following on Kaggle page: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Team $\rightarrow$ Team Name: Change the account for grading as ITSC prefix. }
	\item{Canvas survey $\rightarrow$ Fill in the Kaggle account name.}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Code and Interview}	
Please create a Github repo and put the link on Canvas. If you want your code to be put in private repo please contact TA.

You may be interviewed to demo your code (randomly, but high-rankers more likely). TA will send you email. The interview is roughly 10 mins.
